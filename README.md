# Premier-League-Analysis
This Jupyter Notebook contains analysis of data from the English Premier League's 21-22 season.
I found the team that had committed the most fouls over the course of the season.
I visualized the percentage of draws over the course of the season in a line graph.
I calculated the probability of winning given a team recieved at least 1 red card in a match.
